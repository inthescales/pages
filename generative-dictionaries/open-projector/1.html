                Hello everyone! My name is Robin Hill.
                <br><br>
                Today I’m going to talk about generative dictionaries – programs that generate dictionary entries, with words and meanings.
                <br><br>
                A few years ago I made one called <a href="/projects/lyres-dictionary/">Lyre’s Dictionary</a> in the form of a Twitter bot, and afterward I did some searching online to find similar projects that other people had done.
                <br><br>
                I found a few interesting things that I want to talk about! People have taken different approaches to this, and I’ll describe a few.
            </p>
