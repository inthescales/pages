			Between 2016 and 2022, I made five Twitter bots. Now, four of them are no longer active. This page records their memory.
			Each was created in a brief fit of obsession, but over the years they exhausted their potential and their time came to an end. I put them to rest as the sun set on the golden era of the art bot, but this was my contribution to that moment.

			They are survived by one sibling, <a href="www.lyresdictionary.com">Lyre's Dictionary</a>.

			My first bot was <a>Required Reading</a>, which I made for <a>Procjam 2016</a> and later ported to <a>Mastodon</a>. It posted randomly generated textbook titles, themed around different university courses and assigned a price at random. It was a fruitful experiment in recontextualization â€” it worked by finding thematic keywords in texts from Project Gutenberg and clipping surrounding phrases to become titles.

			My second bot was <a>Gorgar Speaks</a>. <a>Miriam Nadler</a> and I made it together as she shared her love of pinball with me. <a>Gorgar</a>, created in 1979, was the first pinball machine to employ spoken words. Due to technical limitations the machine had a vocabulary of only six words, which were combined in various ways. This constituting a "Gorgar Grammar", it felt appropriate to grant it free rein in a procedural form.

			My third bot was <a>Barbarella GIF Bot</a>. It posted a random gif from the 1968 film Barbarella once each day. It was inspired by <a>Hackers Bot</a> on Mastodon, and both share code taken from an earlier work. I was very enthusiastic about the movie at the time, and this was the result.

			My fifth and final bot was <a>Stock Photo Dog</a>. It debuted on November 6, 2022, and I shut it down on November 7, 2022. Sadly some people who adopt a dog aren't really ready to take care of one. It was meant to be an interactive bot that, if
			you opted-in, would listen to your timeline and respond to any posts that included words like "treat" or "walk" with a photo of an extremely excited dog, intensifying with the number of words. But even after going to the effort of coding it, I got cold feet and didn't want to give myself the burden of maintaining an interactive bot.
